I want you to add a project in the portfolio page. You have the process already documented. You should read the file           
  @docs/how-to-add-project.md .                                                                                                  
  Read and bring the file @../sea-ice-drift/SUMMARY.md from its folder to here. Bring also all the figures that are used in this 
   SUMMARY.md file from the folder @../sea-ice-drift/docs/figures/* . Create the what is necessary for this project. the slug
